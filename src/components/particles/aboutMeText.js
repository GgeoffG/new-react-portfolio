  "Hello, and welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Geoffrey and I'm a, soon to be, certified coder and web programmer. Before beginning my coding journey I helped manage a restaurant for many years which has taught me much about organizing workflow, team building, inventory and money management skills, as well as many other important workplace skills. I've had the pleasure of working on a quite few projects ranging over a vast set of coding and web-development skills during my bootcamp experience and here you can see some of my favorites. If you would like to see more of my work feel free to visit my github or use the contact page to reach out. Thanks for coming by!";
